# üììüîí**Digital Diary** 

### **File Handling Activity in C#**

## Project Description

The Digital Diary Application is a secure diary management system that allows users to write, view, and search diary entries. The entries are encrypted using a simple Caesar cipher to ensure privacy. The application provides the following features:

## Features

- ‚úçÔ∏è**Write a New Entry**: Users can add new diary entries.
- üìñ**View All Entries**: Users can view all diary entries, both encrypted and decrypted.
- üîç**Search Entry by Date**: Users can search for entries by a specific date, with password protection for access.
- üö™**Exit**: Users can exit the application gracefully.

## üîêExplanation of SecureDiary.cs 

The `SecureDiary` class inherits from the base `Diary` class and adds an extra layer of security by encrypting all diary entries before saving them to the file and decrypting them when they are read back. It uses a simple Caesar cipher with a fixed shift to encrypt and decrypt the content. Key features include:

- Overriding `WriteEntry` to automatically encrypt user input before writing to the file.
- Overriding `ViewAllEntries` to decrypt entries when viewed with the correct password.
- A `GetEncryptedEntries` method to show entries in their encrypted form.
- A `SearchByDate` method that allows searching for entries on a specific date with decryption.
- Internal `Encrypt` and `Decrypt` methods that perform the Caesar cipher character shifting.

This implementation ensures that diary entries are stored securely and can only be decrypted by someone who has the password.

## How OOP Principles are Used

The application utilizes several Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles:

- **Encapsulation**: The `Diary` and `SecureDiary` classes encapsulate the functionality related to diary management and encryption, respectively.
- **Inheritance**: The `SecureDiary` class inherits from the `Diary` class, allowing it to extend the functionality of the base class while maintaining a clear structure.
- **Polymorphism**: The `WriteEntry` and `ViewAllEntries` methods are overridden in the `SecureDiary` class to provide specific behavior for encrypted entries.
- **Abstraction**: The implementation details of encryption and file handling are abstracted away from the user, providing a simple interface for diary management.

## Instructions on Running the App

1. Ensure you have .NET SDK installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the application using the command: 
```

   dotnet build

```
5. Run the application using the command: 
```

   dotnet run

```
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the diary.

## File Structure
```

/DigitalDiary
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Program.cs          // Main application logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Diary.cs            // Base diary class
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SecureDiary.cs      // Derived class with encryption features

```
